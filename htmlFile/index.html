        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>A major hobby of mine is writing and worldbuilding - specifically fantasy. There are many ways of writing a story and indeed in building a world. 
            The main things that shape a story are these three main 'drivers': plot, character and theme. We're going to take a look at these below.<br>
            Worldbuilding is a lesser hobby of mine and is an important component to writing fantasy. We will cover some of this as well. 
            Some of the most important aspects of worldbuilding is geography, culture, history and race, which all group into a overarching concept called 'lore'. 
            A key part of worldbuilding is creating maps!
        </p>
        <h2 id = "writing" >Writing</h2>
            <p>
                Writing is an all-consuming and almost selfish task that requires absent as much as active thought. As mentioned, the three main components of writing fantasy
                are plot, character and theme. You will not be able to focus on all three. Realistically, your work will hit two of the three, with a primary focus on just one.

                <h3>Plot</h3>
                    <p>Plot-driven stories tend to be the most enjoyable and exciting for readers and viewers. Plot is how a story develops and tends to 'push' the story to it's climaxes, low points and conclusion.
                        Characters can affect the plot as much as a plot affects characters, so there is not necessarily a clearly defined 'plot-driven' story. 
                        In fact, plot and characters can swap throughout a story as the major driving-force - a good writer can artfully swap between these.
                        An example of a plot-driven story is the trilogy of 'the Lord of the Rings'.

            <article id="characterArticle">
                <h3>Character</h3>
                    <p>Character-driven stories revolve around the motives and actions of characters. 
                        Some of these stories can be absent of any particular plot, per se, but most will have a general story that is being adhered to.
                        Character-based stories have the ability to deviate from an audience's expectations. If the hero is expected to defeat the villain, a character-based
                        story can justify the actions of three-dimensional characters to go against these 'troupes' without confusing or disappointing an audience.
                        Two examples of character-driven stories are the 'Game of Thrones' book series and the film series <a href = "succession.html">'Succession'</a>.

            <article id="themeArticle">
                <h3>Theme</h3>
                    <p>Theme tends to be an underlying concept in any story, rather than a driving-force to a story. A writer, however, may choose to make their theme as the primary focus 
                        to make a point. Usually this is for political or philosophical reasons. One story that is heavily theme-driven is the historical novel, 'The Romance of the Three Kingdoms',
                        which is a fantasy re-imagining of real-life events that unfolding during the fall of the Han Dynasty in ancient China.

                <h3>Lore</h3>
                    <p>Lore is a body of knowledge and tradition that makes up a fantasy world. It comprises of history, culture, race, social norms and so much more. 
                        Whilst it's an abstract concept, think about 'Harry Potter' and you will imagine the castle, the school robes and spells and instantly know it!
                        Creating your own lore will take a lot of time. It will happen gradually as you add more things into the world, and indeed you will change and amend things as you create it!
                        Creating lore also has the strange ability of creating itself, whereby after a certain time, your mind intuitively knows or creates new things to add to it.
                        It is important not to spend too much time working on lore, but to focus on what you need for your story. The rest will develop over time.</p>

                        <p style="color: white;">
                            Here are some questions to ask yourself when creating your own lore:<br>         
                            <ul>
                            <li>What historic events have shaped your world's present? Are there any attitudes and beliefs held by characters because of these events?</li>
                            <li>What culture or cultures are present in your world? What real-world influences are present?</li>
                            <li>What races or ethnicities exist in your world? Are there tensions? Is there a bloody history between groups?</li>
                            <li>Power structures: is there a government, a kingdom, a tribe? How is day-to-day life?</li>
                            <li>What fantasy elements do you want to include? Is there magic? How does magic affect the world, history and day-to-day life?</li>
                        </ul>

                <h3>Maps</h3>
                    <p>
                        An important aspect to some stories is a map of the area where a fantasy story is unfolding. It is primarily a tool for the writer, but many readers enjoy the visual tool to help immersion into a story.
                        It is often advised when creating a map of the world to base it on real-life. This is becasue the geography will be closer to the accuracies of real-life and indeed something relatable for readers.
                        An old troupe of all fantasy maps is the 'sea to the west, uncivilised peoples to the east, jungles and desert to the south and tundra to the north'. 
                        This model is typical from a European's historic point of view and ingrained in millions of minds. 
                        It is best not to adhere to these entirely, but being aware of this and what people visually understand can help in the creation of your own maps.
                        There are many useful sites that allow you to build your own world.        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The website 
                        <a target = "_blank" href = "https://inkarnate.com/">Inkarnate!</a> is a great site for building fantasy maps!

            <h3>The Iceberg Theory</h3>

                data-image="grab"
                style="max-width: 264px;">
                <p>Many fantasy fans and writers will talk about the 'iceberg' theory of the lore of a book or film series. The idea is that what is shown and told in the story is only
                    the surface of larger content hidden beneath the surface. An excellent example of this is the lore of Middle Earth, created by JRR Tolkien. Readers and viewers of the 
                    books and films enjoy the story withoutu being shown the full extent of history, language or culture. As a writer, however, the real practically of creating a rich world
                    AND writing a story is not practical. George R R Martin referred to his own lore iceberg as a raft of ice floating on the sea. This is due to the impracticality of 
                    creating history, culture and other things that don't impact the story you're writing.
                    Indeed, one of the most accomplished and 'fastest' writers, Brandon Sanderson, speaks about the 'hollow iceberg', stating that as a writer. your goal is to give the appearence that your lore 
                    goes really deep, but you merely leave gaps to fill at later stages. You might reference a war that happened a hundred years ago without actually thinking up why or how
                    it happened. As long as there's no inconsistencies or paradoxes, this is an essential tool!
