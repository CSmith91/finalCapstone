        <p>
            Succession is the story of a partiarchal mutli-billionaire family. The head of the family is a brash, brutal old man with declining health, who toys with his children
            as to who will essentailly inherit his role as CEO for his company. Logan Roy, the father, flits between being in full control of the company, to stepping back as just
            a shareholder. His changing presence and dramatic decline of his health leaves a fluctuating void of power that pulls in his three (four) children, son-in-law and great-nephew, 
            as well as rival companies circling the corporate waters like sharks. 
            Succession's primary writer is Jesse Armstrong, who is most known for writing Peep Show, a staple of British comedy.

        <h2>Character-based Writing</h2>
        <p>This show focuses primarily on characters, rather than plot. The ambitions of characters, their ever-changing relationships with each other reflect an incredibly 
            engaging plot. I consider this <em>the</em> best show ever written. I hasten to add, that endings are incredibly important, and this series has yet to conclude.

        <h2>Theme-based story</h2>
        <p>
            Whilst one theme in Succession is clearly defined as power, the characters' twists and turns dominate the style of story-telling. A better example of a theme-driven story is 
            <a href = "ro3kingdoms.html">'Romance of the Three Kingdoms'</a>.
