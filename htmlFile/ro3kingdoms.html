            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Romance of the Three Kingdoms is about the real-life events (told with fantasy elements) that unfolded following the fall of the Han Dynasty.
                The story shows the development of the once unified China into three separate kingdoms or states, called Wei, Wu and Shu.
                The overarching theme for this story is how angered and disappointed the characters are with the corruption and decline of the country,
                and each vow to restore or otherwise renew the country, imposing their methods and ideologies.
                The story tragically ends with none of the states achieving their ambitions, and a fourth state usurping the state of Wei, finally unifying China.
            </p>
            <p>A further tragedy about the story is it HUGE. It is 800,000 words. It is sad to see that the excitement at the beginning of the story slowly turns to a drudge, and 
                warriors and strategists achieve great feats and win battles against all the odds, only to be increasingly undermined by increasingly anonymous politicians behind a desk.
                The intention of slowly detaching the reader from characters towards the end of the novel is rather clever, as it serves to highlight the theme being shown.
                Indeed, everything the characters hated at the start of the story slowly begins to return, and so with the reader invested, becomes a shared frustration.
                The time spent reading the book twins quite poetically with the real lives of these characters and the story that unfolds.

            <h2>The Fate of Each State</h2>
            <p>As mentioned on the home page, Romance of the Three Kingdoms has a strong theme, that being the cyclical nature of states. Each state is affected as follows:</p>
            <p>Shu was founded on the ideals of loyalty and restoration of the Han Dynasty (the 'true' heir), 
                but ultimately fell due to blind loyalty (serving incompetant rulers) and corruption in the court, leading to their surrender to Wei.</p>
            <p>Wei was founded as a meritocracy, and promoted bettering oneself in a government structure,
                but fell due to backstabbing and usurpation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Wu was founded on the ideals of family values and vassels loyal the family, but this lead to cruel officials (and others turning a blind eye) and infighting, 
                leaving them open to invasion.

        <h2>Character-based story</h2>
        <p>
            Whilst the characters in 'Romance of the Three Kingdoms' are legendary, such as Lu Bu or Guan Yu, a better example of a character-driven story is
